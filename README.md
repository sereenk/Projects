# GET YOUR OWN SPOTIFY WRAPPED WITH SOME MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS OF YOUR MUSICAL INCLINATIONS!

# ABOUT 

This is my final project for an Intermediate Python Programming class(SI 507) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. A couple of days ago, I saw my spotify wrapped and that made me so excited! However, I wanted to see some more information on my musical inclinations. So I wondered, what if I try making it for my top artist tracks? So, I decided to do a project using Spotify'a API and the iTunes API. I accesssed the API, retreived my information, processed it to create a data frame and then create some visualizations. I wanted to make it interactive, so that non-spotify users can use this as well. So I added in an itunes option for users to search a particular term within the itunes API so they can see its respective songs, books, and other related information!

## DATA SOURCES : 

### 1. SPOTIFY API 
The first data source is the spotify api.

### 2. I-TUNES API :

The second source was the ITUNES API. The data will be retreived from this API depending upon what the user searches. The data will then be processed and stored  as lists and information will be finally returned to the user.

Here is some more information on the API - https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/
